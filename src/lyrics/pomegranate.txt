hey, how have you been my dear
i know we haven’t spoken for a while now
even though i needed space to clear my mind from you
i don’t want you to think i forgot about

sometimes i wish i could have found your hand
i know you tried your best to understand me
you worked so hard to speak my tongue
and though you didn’t get it all
you could tell me about the softness in your heart

some nights that we spent
cast a shadow on my mood
reflecting on where i am
thinking about lives i could have had

you told me of mountains
white and far away
will i ever see them
will i ever see myself
like you saw me blossom
drinking from the rain you brought

i’m falling over myself again
i’d like to stay your friend
i’ve been so deep inside of you

hey, i’d like to feature in your life (sometimes)
at least if you agree (can we)
if you see that in me // if you’ll let me (i’m here)
i care so much for you (my cup)
you’ve been my special role (my girl)
i’ll always wish you well (my friend)
count on me for help (i’ll be)
you’ll always be
my pomegranate, my cup, my tea, my girl
my dear, my dear, my clouds, my shrug
my fear, my girl, my touch, my hug
my boy, my drug, my sadness
