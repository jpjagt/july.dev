we met one night in the city of clubs
going outside for cigarettes and there he was
fake leather jacket and his diamond studs
his soft red lips, i was dripping with lust

came up to me and he gave me his light
said what’s your name and what you doing tonight
i couldn’t answer, i felt like right there
i’d give my heart for the look in his eyes

we’re back inside, me and him started dancing
oh and our eyes started touching intensely
but right before we kissed he turned and moved out of sight
and i couldn’t find him for the rest of the night

oh i’ve been stuck in my room for three days
i’ve only been thinking of you for three days
straight about what i don’t possess
for three days i have been completely obsessed
for three days


the weather changed and weeks went by
on the weekends i’d go dancing, trying to find him
i saw him and his friends smoking outside

he greeted me but his mood was distant
asked him what had happened but he’s acting indifferent
i told him that night i had wanted to kiss him
and he just looked at me, oh

and now he tells me not to think that we've got a chance
he’s saying things i don’t want to understand
he says if you want then we can be friends
but baby don’t think i can settle for that

oh i’ve been stuck in my room for three days
i’ve only been thinking of you for three days
straight about the things we possessed
for three days i have been completely obsessed
for three days
