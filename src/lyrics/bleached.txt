you had a dream
a dream to live in hotel rooms and write your scenes
and to forget
you thought you’d throw your hooks in waters i didn’t see
but i see through the secrets that you thought you’d keep
yeah bitch that’s me,
yeah bitch that’s me

grey skies give you an empty heart
long hair falling down
holes in your old, leather jacket
wandering the streets in hand-me-downs

smoking cigarettes in an empty room
you never believed what you’d be
i know you’re not waiting for me girl
i know that it’s not what you need

running through your thoughts when you’re not alone
the world isn’t far from what it seemed
you should go outside, it’s your time now
disappear like the hair that you bleached

walk yourself off, midnight’s what you want
make yourself small and overlooked

you thought you’d see the world that you loved
things unlocked as you’ll find inner peace

smoking cigarettes in an empty room
you never believed what you’d be
i know you’re not waiting for me girl
i know that it’s not what you need

running through your thoughts when you’re not alone
the world isn’t far from what it seemed
you should go outside, it’s your time now
flow like the hair that you bleached

you live life like a movie
a movie and a dream
can’t fall asleep during storms
waiting for

you had a dream
a dream to live in hotel rooms and write your scenes
