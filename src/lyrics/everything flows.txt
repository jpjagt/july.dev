i know that i’m not in a place where i can ask you
but please don’t go
i cannot make all of these dreams all by my own
i cannot face my biggest demons all alone

i know that i’m not in a place where i can ask you
but please don’t go
i cannot make all of these dreams all by my own
i cannot face my biggest demons all alone

everything falls
everything flows
the stage crumbled down but the show must go on
hands in the crowd
a moment alone
your face in the crowd

(vocoder)
all falls into me
will they find someone else now
will they know you better somehow

all of theses voices talk too much to me
flights most of the weeks, still so much to see
it just overwhelms, turn the lights down please
let there be some quiet for a night now
just this night now please
turn those lights off please
it’s been four weeks straight
and we still don’t speak
how can i have so
much of what i sought (wanted)
and be so far from
what i need

i need, i need, i neeeeed

i know that i’m not in a place where i can ask you
but please don’t go
i cannot make all of these dreams all by my own
i cannot face my biggest demons all alone

i know that i’m not in a place where i can ask you
but please don’t go
i cannot make all of these dreams all by my own
i cannot face my biggest demons all alone

(vocoder)
i know that i’m not in a place where i can ask you
but please don’t go
i don’t find meaning in those dreams when i’m alone
i cannot face my biggest demons by my own
i cannot face all of these demons by my own
