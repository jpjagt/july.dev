i’ve got my nikes
i’ve got my hat
i should take a walk today

i’ve got my books
my cup of tea
venus keeps me company

i’ve got my headphones
on my head
left-side speaker’s nearly dead

after breakfast
i’m in my room
not much dishes left to do

my laptop greets me
how are you
it’s nine to ten, there’s mail for two (two)

look out the window
i sigh and breathe
when i’d feel alone, you’d stay home with me

we’d open the windows wide
the light would drift in, make us blind
now there’s clouds, now i see
that was what it meant to be free

—

it’s two to three
got lost in work
phone rang but i hadn’t heard

i rang and heard
my sister say
she wanted to check up on me today

i told her venus
was on my lap
the softest cat i’ve ever had

i heard her sigh
heard her say sweet
she told me don’t forget to eat

i had forgotten
it’s good she did
took leftover from the fridge

i took my time
ate consciously
percussion of my cutlery

i looked outside
and saw two birds
flying far far from the earth

it made me sad
i wondered whether
they would come back down together

and now, it’s already six
the sun is down, i feel like clay
what happened to my walk today
i’ll go and hope it’s not too late
down, and left, and out
this time of year is when you’d stay
i’ll always love the smell of may
i’m hoping not too much will change
from here on out
