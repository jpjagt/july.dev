glass breaking light
midsummer daze
met you during the nighttime
you and all your grace
im imagining your nights now
long as they are
trails of your headlights
faster than thought
coming straight out of a tunnel
and seeing the light of dawn
speeding on your motorbike
two wheels touched by god
think of your life in a new way
as the wind’s hitting your face
maybe enter a new mode
turn over a page
talk about change of seasons
but you’re still feeling cold
until you wake up one day
and notice that you’re moving on
notice that you’re moving on
notice that you’ve moved on

i guess we tried without (me) knowing i didn’t want it
you were so sweet with me, sugar i’m forever honoured
for your gracious attitude, you always stayed calm
while i was looking my demons in the eye, you pushed me on
while i was learning to come up on two legs, you caught my falls
made me stand myself, showed me a me i’d never known

so much of me came from you
and now you can’t even see that
what years of living in two
brought out of me yeah
now i no longer see you
and i don’t know where you’re staying at
i don’t know what you do
but i bet it’s something you’re good at

i bet it’s something you kick ass at
like everything you do
