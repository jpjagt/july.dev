leaving by myself
the sky is showing dawn
body kept inside
waiting for so long

winters without light
the cold is not yet gone
hands that feel like ice
mind to moving on

walking after rain
meeting you one time
playing you this song
telling you that

and i wish it felt older
& it wasn’t new
and i just wanna call you
and listen to you
and i know that you’ve loved me
and you know i do
did i hurt you some way
that made you choose?

and i wish i was someone
you don’t want to lose
and you give me the freedom
i don’t want to use
and i want you to kiss me
in the way you do
make me see the world red
the world blue

you’ve seen the world with me
i've seen life with you
covering my eyes
hope that snow falls soon

laying on the floor
i’m feeling good
i’m feeling calm
i’m feeling empty
feeling defenseless
empty and endless
my skin is soft
my skin is warm
laying on the floor
feeling defenseless
i’m feeling calm
empty and endless
