your skin and your warmth (felt)
on me
slithering tongues (felt)
on me
on me
on me for a while

the curve of your lips (in)
my lens
your fingertips (on)
my hands
(on) my skin
was red where you touched me

the smell of your smoke (in)
my shirt
these memories
won’t hurt
(they) won’t hurt
# i will cherish them forever
i go through them like the weather

self-obsessed and
in sync
there was so much rain
that week
there were friends to see (fantasies)
planting seeds (jewelry)
days of heat
you and me
naps with fleeting dreams (and light)
read between the lines
meaning hid inside
of every word

flat and unformed (i’m)
confused
an empty sky (in)
my view
this blue
i’m submerged in the blue

the smell of your smoke (in)
my shirt
these memories
won’t hurt
(they) won’t hurt
if i manage to forget them

we spent three weeks together
it seemed they wouldn’t end
now i’m scared i’ll always remember
how beautifully and unreachably
how close to me and irreplaceably
they were spent
