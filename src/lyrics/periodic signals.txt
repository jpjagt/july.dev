and how can i ever sway you from my space
bending time, melting ways

wouldn’t it always gone like this
sometimes brave, sometimes anxious

wasn’t it clear to you like it was clear to me
that this was how it was gonna be

the road will lead off into somewhere
we follow it, we don’t care
on bikes gliding over the track
wind blows on our back

out in the grass, summertime
river’s cool, hairs dripping wet
memories dripping off with you
when i play them back

wouldn’t it always be like this
sometimes brave, or anxious
wouldn’t it always be like this
if it started off like this

now i’m drifting in the pool
the sun is high, the water’s blue
but it stays without you

clear to me, was it clear to you
was it clear to you, that you touched me too
like the sun is high, drifting in the pool
was it clear to me, clear to you
like the water’s blue, what it’s like with you
