i want you to know
that i love you so
i need you now
your kindness

there’s a thousand planes
over me
real high
and a thousand days
go by

everywhere we move
do we know why? (for you)


there’s a thousand lines
on the plains
of our life
how many of those lines
are mine

i need you when i
am lost in the world
your words, your hands
they remind me

and those thousand planes
i was in
the sky
on those thousand days
gone by

where are we
moving out, in the night? (or not)
this life is free
we leave (so) much behind

that endless search
for the stars
for the sky
while a thousand nights / worlds
pass by
