movements in the dark
vanish when they’re seen
waking up by myself among
the memories of a dream

days of feeling empty
days of feeling sad
days of feeling free

fugitive emotion
questioning the notion
of what it means to be

we have tried again
we have been what we were meant to be
we have bound ourselves together
i guess we’ll have to learn to set us free

don’t you cry, my love
we have been what we were meant to be
no pasa nada, no pasa nada
though you’ve been everything to me
