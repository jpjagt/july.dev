darkness in your eyes
redness of your mouth
tryna go to zero
strangling your thoughts
blackness all around us
in this lonely room
making you a filmtape
loving you i do

changes in your life
meet you in the dark
i will do this dance with you
until you find your heart
come down little star
shine for me tonight
i won't try to hurt you
when you need to hide

pulsing signs of life
dreaming by yourself
light years of nothing
that you keep around
won’t i understand you
even if i try
won’t i come near you
won’t i be your light

tell me if there’s someone
orbiting your life
say to me there’s someone
that you’ve let inside
if things are as you say
and you've felt love
you've come a long long way
my little star i see
my little darling light
