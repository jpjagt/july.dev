you wake up, you get up and
there, you’re feeling sad
you’re looking at, an empty bed,
forget the dreams you’ve had

the sun falls in the kitchen, mor-
ning cup of tea in hand
but not your tea, not the sun,
can make you feel less bad

cuz boy you’ve misbehaved
and though you say you’ve changed
the next time that you could
won’t you choose to do the same

she tells you that she needs some time,
she needs some space, she will come back
you doubt her words, you’ve hurt her bad
though it was a heated act

you’ve never realized quite how much
all the things you own
remind you of her presence
now that you’re standing here alone

laying in your bed
standing in your home
wondering maybe i deserve this feeling
in my heart

cuz boy you’ve misbehaved
and though you say you’ve changed
the next time that you could
won’t you choose to do the same

and now you start to doubt
yourself in many ways
waiting for her visit
thinking what you’ll say

do you love her still
will you love her, will
you change for her and be there
in the way that she’s there
in the way she needs you
the same way she completes you

cuz boy you’ve misbehaved
and though you’ll try to change
the next time that you could
won’t you choose to do the same
